# Advent of Code

Let's do a new programing language I've never touched before every day (â“¿_â“¿)

## Progress

* Day 1: ~~Ruby~~ Windows Batch
* Day 2: Scratch (run by loading file on [Scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted) [File->Load from your computer])
* Day 3: F#
* Day 4: Julia
* Day 5: Visual Basic
* Day 6: R
* Day 7: Pascal
* Day 8: OCaml
* Day 9: Cobol
* Day 10: D
* Day 11: Ruby
* Day 12: CoffeeScript
* Day 13: Clojure
* Day 14: Scala
* Day 15: Dart
* Day 16: AWK
* Day 17: Nix
* Day 18: 
* Day 19: 
* Day 20: Ada (In progress)
* Day 21: Prolog
* Day 22: 
* Day 23: 
* Day 24: 
* Day 25: 

\* Note: I am only doing part 1 because I don't hate myself that much ðŸ˜³ (JK I did #11 because it had the least amount of ppl on just part 1)

[I think these later ones are too hard and time consuming without dynamic and easily usable arrays, hashmaps and other useful data structures and take twice the time because I need to solve it first then implement it in some programming language I've never done before]
